# static-demo-blocklet

This is a blocklet demo of the 2048 game used to demonstrate how to install and run a blocklet on your Blocklet Server. It is a pure front-end web application written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. You may already have some basic understanding of [Blocklet](https://www.arcblock.io/en/blocklets) and [Blocklet Server](https://www.arcblock.io/en/node). Now you can have your own blocklet set up and running in just a few minutes.
